# Practical NLP Text Summarization - Unveiling Text Summarization Techniques

In this notebook, we will delve into two fundamental methods for text summarization: extractive and abstractive. We will also explore ways to evaluate their effectiveness.

**Extractive Summarization**: In this approach, we pick crucial sentences or phrases directly from the input text to create the summary.

**Abstractive Summarization**: Here, we generate summaries by rephrasing and paraphrasing sentences to create a coherent summary.

**Evaluation Metrics**: To assess the performance of these summarization techniques, we will focus on the ROUGE metric.

**Real-world Relevance**: Text summarization finds practical applications across various industries and domains.
